\section*{Introduction}
For this class the project we were given was to develop a simulation of the layers of a network with a GUI to show how the packets moved through
the network.

\section*{Contribution}
My contribution to the group was the datastructure that held all of the node objects and their associated connections and packets as well as ways
to retrieve these objects and their relationships. This required me to work closely with the back-end team, namely Jeremy, Rhys, and Nav to see
what sort of functionality they would require.

\section*{Feedback}
This project seemed to be poorly thought out on all fronts. The task we were given would have been too large to realistically finish in the
provided time, the group size was far too large, and the people in charge had no definite plans on how everything would fit together. The only reason
we got as far as we did is because we ended up building something that looks like it's simulating a network rather than actually simulating a
network.
