\section*{Introduction}
For our project we were asked to design and implement a file system for NAND based flash memory, the functionality we wanted was and write for
both files and directories. We decided to go with a heavily simplified version of inode because inode is well documented and seemed fairly simple to
implement.

\section*{Contribution}
It is hard to say what specific part of the project we each worked on since we all worked on the same things with a fair amount of pair programming.
The parts I specialized in the most are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item since I was the only one with a history in C I think it's fair to say I had the best understanding of pointers and so did a fair amount
  of debugging in that area
\item I helped in the design of our data structures and it was me who wrote our first implementation of all of the required structs
\item due to my understanding of C's memory model I also worked a fair bit with our de/serialization functions
\end{itemize}

\section*{Feedback}
I quite enjoyed learning about filesystems and how they work but a lot of the information we were given was wrong. We were told we would need to
write a FTL when in fact that was not the case so we wasted a lot of time there. The papers we were given talked about the specifics
of implementing a filesystem on NAND flash drives talked a lot about the FTL while really glazing over the data structures involved in
the filesystem part of the project.
