\section*{Learning outcomes}
The main thing I learned preparing for this debate was that our industry still has a long way to go if we want to be taken seriously as
engineers. We will need some sort of regulatory body that holds us responsible for our ethical and professional wrongdoings. We will
also need a better set of frameworks to make building software more a matter of combining proven concepts then a matter of solving
a new unique problem for every project.

\section*{Feedback}
For a debate to work it needs to have two sides that might be right, this topic seemed pretty one sided both in it's legal definition as well
as from a common sense standpoint. This makes it so one side has to basically invent points of debate in order to be able to say anything at all.
As far as the benefits of a debate go it definitely requires us as students to research and learn a lot about a topic we may have otherwise ignored.
